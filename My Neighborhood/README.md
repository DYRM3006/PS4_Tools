# My Neighborhood 

This is an open source version (alternative) of the PS4 Neighborhood that came with the official ps4 sdk 

Follow development board on trello

## What can i do with this ?

This is mainly for developer use on any console that has unsigned code enabled and has the corresponding api installed (release to be announced)

With this you can create your own application / games for ps4 homebrew and instead of creating a pkg each time you can simply attach the application / game to your file serving directory and load your current application in real time (that's the idea anyway)

The project is to resemble the official PlayStation 4 Neighborhood without any of the SCE tools


## Requirements 

* API Installed
* System must be running a semi dev unit (not normal retail)

To change your console from Normal Retail to a Semi Dev one simply use LightningMods's Updater


Console output will look similar to this
